title1
'Research Question: What are top 5 countries experienced biggest increase in happiness rank from 2016 to 2107?'
;

title2
'Rationale: This should help identify top countries that are potentially gaining more life satisfaction over year.'
;

footnote1
"According to this table, the top five countires top 5 countries that experienced biggest increase in happiness rank from 2015 to 2106 were Algeria, Latvia, Cameroon, Egypt and Romania"
;

footnote2
"These are all developing countries, 3 of which are in Europe and the other 2 are in Africa"
;

footnote3
"The biggest rank increase in happiness of these countries could be due to their good development potential, their recent changes in economy, infrastructure and so on"
;

*
Note:This compares the column “Happiness Rank” from happy_2015 to the column 
of the same name from happy_2016.

Methodology: When combining happy_2015 with happy_2016 during data preparation,
take the difference of values of "happiness_rank" for each school and create 
a new variable called happiness_rank_yoy. Then, use proc sort to create a 
temporary sorted table in descending by happiness_rank_yoy. Finally, use proc 
print here to display the first five rows of the sorted dataset.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for countries with missing data,
nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, like filtering for percentages
between 0 and 1.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any possible
illegal values, and better handle missing data, e.g., by using a previous year's
data or a rolling average of previous years' data as a proxy.

title1
'Research Question: Is "GPI" in a relationship with "Happiness Score" ?'
;

title2
'Rationale: This will help determine if peace status of a country makes people happier'
;

footnote1
"Contrary to traditional belief that high peace index should always go with high happiness score, from this result, it can be seen that there's some negative correlation between gpi and happiness score."
;

footnote2
"A possible explaination is that While the variables used to determined GPI are more related to political issues, the variables used to measure happiness score are more related to life such as : economy, health, social support etc. A nation with high GPI doesnt necessarily achieve high quality healthcare or social support system. "
;

footnote3
"Further investigation and other methods should be performed to examine the correlation of the 2 varibles as well as the level of statistical significance of the result."
; 

*
Note:This compares the column “gpi” from gpi_2008-2016 to the column 
happiness_score from happy_2016.

Methodology:Use proc means to compute 5-number summaries of gpi 
and happiness_score. Then use proc format to create formats that bin both 
columns with respect to the proc means output.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for countries with missing 
data,nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, like filtering for 
percentages between 0 and 1.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any 
possible illegal values, and better handle missing data, e.g., by using 
a previous year's data or a rolling average of previous years' data as a proxy.

title1
'Is there a correlation between “Biocapacity Deficit or Reserve” and “Happiness Score”? '
;

title2
'Rationale:Biocapacity Deficit or Reserve reveals the sustainability status of a country, which can lead to a happier fulfilled life'
;

footnote1
"The result shows a negative relation between the 2 variables "
;

footnote2
"However, Pearson Chi-Sq Test shows p-value > 0.05, therefore there is not enough evidence to show the correlation between “Biocapacity Deficit or Reserve” and “Happiness Score”"
;

*
Note: This compares the column biocapacity_deficit_or_reserve from eco_2016
to the column happiness_score in happy_2016.
    
Methodology: Use PROC CORR can to compute Pearson product-moment correlation 
coefficient between biocapacity_deficit_or_reserve and happiness_score, 
as well as Spearman's rank-order correlation, a nonparametric measures of 
association. PROC CORR also computes simple descriptive statistics.  

Limitations: This methodology does not account for countries with missing data,
nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, like filtering for values
outside of admissable values.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean the values of variables so that the
statistics computed do not include any possible illegal values, and better
handle missing data, e.g.,.
