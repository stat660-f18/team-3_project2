"Research Question:  For the 20 largest countries, what are the top five countries that experienced the biggest decrease in Happiness Score between 2015 and 2016?"
;

title2
"Rationale: This will help identify countries that have decline in life satisfaction."
;

footnote1
"Of the largest 20 countries, the top five countries with the greatest decreases in happiness score between 2015 and 2016 ranged between 2% and 8% decline."
;

footnote2
"Nigeria had the largest decline in happiness score from 2015 to 2016.  This might be connected to Boko Haram kidnappings, Movement for Actualization of Biafra Repulic, and Niger Delta Avengers bombing pipelines in the country."
;

footnote3
"However, assuming there are no data issues underlying this analysis, possible explanations for such volatilities is due to the small population size. Note China has 1.4B people while U.S. has 320MM people."

/*
Note: This compares the column Happiness Score from happy_2015 to the 
column of the same name from happy_2016.

Methodology: When combining happy_2016 with happy_2015 during data 
preparation, take the difference of values of happiness_score for each
country and create a new variable called happiness_score_yoy. Then,
use proc sort to create a temporary sorted table in descending by
happiness_score_yoy. Finally, use proc print here to display the
first five rows of the sorted dataset.

Limitations: This methodology does not account for country's with missing data,
nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, like filtering for percentages
between 0 and 1.

Follow-up Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any 
possible illegal values, and better handle missing data, e.g., by using a 
previous year's data or a rolling average of previous years' data as a proxy.

'Research Question: Can "GPI" predict the "Happiness Score" in 2016?'
; 

title2
'Rationale: This will help determine if peace status makes people happier.  Ideally, we want to find the potential drivers that may have caused the biggest decline in "Happiness Score".'
;

footnote1
'Applying simple linear regression model, it can be seen, that 22% of the variability in happiness score can be explained by GPI. The lower the GPI the higher the Happiness Score.';
;

footnote2
'Since p-value <.0001 for GPI "Pr>|T|", we can conclude that GPI has significant linear effect on Happiness Score.'
;

footnote3
'A nation is considered more peaceful when the index score is lower.  The index is based on ongoing conflict, safety and security, and militarisation.'

*******************************************************************************;
/*
Note: This compares the change in GPI between 2015 and 2016 in gpi_raw 
dataset to the column "Happiness Score" in happy_2016 dataset.

Methodology: Use proc glm to build simple linear regression y = b0 + b1x + e.
First check to see if the Y-Happiness Score and X - GPI are highly
correlated. If not continue to build model than check test model assumptions.
  Model Assumptions 
  1) Dependent variable must be continuous
  2) IID Criterion that means the error terms, e, are:
   a. independent from one another and
   b. identically distributed
   - Normally distributed residuals e (Residuals appear even band around 0)
   - Error variance is the same for all observations
  3) Y observations are not correlated with each other

    Model Results
    Happiness Score = 7.648 + (-1.104)*GPI
    Type III SS p-value < 0.0001
    22% of the variability in happiness score is explained by GPI

    Correlation shows show -46.911% correlation. Thusly, not correlated can go 
    to next step. Test for Residual normality, shows Shapiro-Wilk 0.2089>=0.05, 
    failed to reject Ho, residuals are normally distributed.

Goal: Find straight line that minimizes sum of squared distances from actual 
weight to fitted line

Limitations: Here we only looked at one variable to predict happiness score.
Based on the results, there is negative linear effect on Happiness score. And
only 22% can be explained by GPI.  

Follow-up Steps: A possible follow-up is add additional X variables to improve
model predictiveness.

;

title2
"Rationale: It is believed that improving HDI reduces health disparities, which can lead to a longer life."
;

footnote1
'Life Expectancy and HDI (Human Development Index) have stastically significant linear relationship (r=0.91,p<0.0001).'
;

footnote2
"The direction of the relationship is positive, meaning the greater the HDI the greater the Life Expectancy."
;

footnote3
"We expect strong correlation since the human development index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators."
;

*******************************************************************************;
/*
Note: This compares the column "HDI" from eco_2016 to the column 
"Life Expectancy" in happy_2016. 

Methodology: Use PROC CORR can to compute Pearson product-moment correlation 
coefficient between hdi and life_expectancy, as well as Spearman's 
rank-order correlation, a nonparametric measures of association. PROC CORR 
also computes simple descriptive statistics.  

Limitations: Data dictionary is limited. The methodology does not account for 
countries with missing data, nor does it attempt to validate data in any way, 
like filtering for percentages between 0 and 1.

Possible Follow-up Steps: More carefully clean the values of the variables
so that the means computed do not include any possible illegal values. 
And use proc plot to generate a graph of the variable hdi against 
life expectancy.
